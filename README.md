### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is John Moore. Iâ€™m a **Fullstack Software Engineer** working as an **Architect**, currently pursuing a **Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science**.

My journey into tech began during my college years, where I earned a **Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mechanical Engineering**. After graduation, I spent nearly 5 years (4 years and 9 months) in the Army, managing maintenance, logistics, and people during the workday while exploring my passion for programming in my free time.

Serving my country was an incredible experience, but I was ready for a new challenge. This led me to transition into a full-time career as a Software Engineer. Recently, Iâ€™ve been focusing on sharpening my skills in Architecture and I am mainly open to **Software Architect** or **Software Engineer (Systems)** roles.

Feel free to connect with me if youâ€™d like to collaborate or discuss potential opportunities.

A lot of my recent work has been for school and the repos have to remain private but I would love to talk about them!

- Distributed File System (C++)
- Proxy and Cache using Libcurl and a variety of IPC (C)
- Variety of Finance focussed ML Projects (Python)
- Cyber Security focused work
  - Binary Exploitation
  - Web Security
  - SQLi
  - and many others!
- Robotics focussed work
  - PID Controller
  - Kalman Filter
  - SLAM

And of course lots more. For fun right now I am slowly making a [Balatro Calculator](https://github.com/JMoooore/Balatro-Calculator) using C and [Astro Nvim](https://astronvim.com/)!
